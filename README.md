## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I realy learnt a lot during this challenge. I was able to learn about Pseudo in css. Both the Pseudo class and Pseudo elements.

One full-column ':' is used for the classes and two full-column '::' is used for the Elements

### Continued development

Although I didn't use it to complete this challenge, because I'm still yet to get full graps of it. I want to focus on using the Pseudo classes. I want to go beyond the ::before and ::after Pseudo Elements.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://youtu.be/OtBpgtqrjyo) - This helped me in understanding Pseudo classes and Element. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Resource 2](https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-create-fancy-corners-in-css/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
